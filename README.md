# 42 Piscine â€“ C Programming Bootcamp

This repository contains the projects completed during the **Piscine** (French for "swimming pool") phase at [42 School](https://42.fr/), an intensive 26-day C programming bootcamp designed to test and develop problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and persistence under pressure.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The Piscine challenges participants with daily tasks, peer evaluations, weekend exams, and collaborative projects. The focus is on mastering the fundamentals of C programming, UNIX systems, memory management, and algorithmic thinking â€” all without formal instruction.

## ðŸ”§ Topics Covered

- C syntax and compilation
- Memory allocation and pointer arithmetic
- Custom string and array manipulation
- Recursion and algorithm design
- File I/O and terminal operations
- Norminette coding standard
- Peer code review and correction

## ðŸ’¡ Methodology

- **Peer Learning**: All assessments are done by peers, encouraging communication and critical thinking.
- **Project-Based**: No lectures â€” learning happens through doing.
- **Moulinette**: Automated correction system for objective project evaluation.
- **Norminette**: Enforced style and format guide for C code.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation

Each task is graded via:
- **Functional correctness**: Does the program work as expected?
- **Code style**: Does it conform to Norminette rules?
- **Peer review**: Can others read and understand your logic?

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All code is written in **pure C** using a **UNIX-based environment**.
- Some subfolders may contain test files and external evaluators (e.g., libft-unit-test).
- Projects are self-contained and follow incremental difficulty.

## ðŸ§  Conclusion

This repository showcases the journey through 42â€™s unique and challenging Piscine phase â€” a valuable experience for anyone aiming to become a self-sufficient developer.
