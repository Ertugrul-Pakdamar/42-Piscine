## 🔧 Topics Covered

- C syntax and compilation
- Memory allocation and pointer arithmetic
- Custom string and array manipulation
- Recursion and algorithm design
- File I/O and terminal operations
- Norminette coding standard
- Peer code review and correction

## 💡 Methodology

- **Peer Learning**: All assessments are done by peers, encouraging communication and critical thinking.
- **Project-Based**: No lectures — learning happens through doing.
- **Moulinette**: Automated correction system for objective project evaluation.
- **Norminette**: Enforced style and format guide for C code.

## 📊 Evaluation

Each task is graded via:
- **Functional correctness**: Does the program work as expected?
- **Code style**: Does it conform to Norminette rules?
- **Peer review**: Can others read and understand your logic?

## 📌 Notes

- All code is written in **pure C** using a **UNIX-based environment**.
- Some subfolders may contain test files and external evaluators.
- Projects are self-contained and follow incremental difficulty.

## 🧠 Conclusion

This repository showcases the journey through 42’s unique and challenging Piscine phase — a valuable experience for anyone aiming to become a self-sufficient developer.
